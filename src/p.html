<p>On December 5, 2022, we received the devastating news of the loss of Nuno.&nbsp;😔</p>
<p>
  Nuno was an incredible person who touched the lives of so many of us. In his honor, we have come together to start a non-profit organization dedicated to keeping his name alive and spreading awareness about an issue that affected his life -
  fentanyl, an opiate.
</p>
<p>Fentanyl is a dangerous substance that has been causing immense harm and destruction in our communities. It is vital that we understand the dangers it poses and work towards eradicating its use to prevent further tragedy.</p>
<p>
  Through our non-profit, we aim to raise awareness about the lethal consequences of fentanyl and opioid addiction. Our mission is to educate individuals, families, and communities about the risks associated with fentanyl use, and advocate for proper
  prevention, treatment, and support.
</p>
<p>
  We firmly believe that knowledge is power, and by joining forces, we can make a difference. We invite all of you to come along on this journey with us. Together, we can spread awareness, support those affected by fentanyl addiction, and work
  towards a safer and healthier community.
</p>
<p>If you would like to contribute to our cause, whether through donations, volunteering, or simply spreading the word, please reach out to us. Every little effort counts, and your support will make a significant impact.</p>
